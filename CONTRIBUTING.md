## Guidelines for contributing code

1.  **Black** with default settings for formatting.
2.  Write unit tests for code and strive for 100% coverage.  If you need help with tests, by all means, ask.
3.  [Google DocString Styling](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html). Spend time writing docstrings that are clear and easy to understand. 
4.  **Type Annotations** where possible.
